World Happiness Report Analysis (2015–2019)

Overview

This project analyzes the World Happiness Report rankings between 2015 and 2019, with a special focus on India’s performance compared to top-ranked countries.

The study highlights:

India’s ranking dropped significantly from 117 (2015) to 140 (2019).
The decline is linked to a consistent decrease in factors contributing to the Happiness Score.
In contrast, the top-ranked countries maintained stable scores due to steady contributing factors.

Key Insights

India’s Decline: India’s ranking dropped because important factors like income, social support, health, freedom, generosity, and trust in government went down over the years.
Top Countries’ Stability: Countries like Finland, Denmark, and Norway stayed at the top because these factors remained steady or improved slightly.
Comparison: Looking at India alongside the top countries shows how strong social, economic, and cultural stability helps maintain higher happiness levels.
